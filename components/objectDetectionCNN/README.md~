#``` objectDetectionCNN```
This is code for object detection using CNN and image processing.
It provides proxy for  


## Configuration parameters
As any other component,
``` *objectDetectionCNN* ```
needs a configuration file to start. In

    etc/config
    etc/caffe_config

you can find an example of a configuration file in /etc. You need to install caffe and change required paths in  caffe_config.
    
#Starting the component
To avoid changing the *config* file in the repository, we can copy it to the component's home directory, so changes will remain untouched by future git pulls:

    cd

``` <objectDetectionCNN 's path> ```

    cp etc/config config
    
After editing the new config file we can run the component:

    bin/

```./objectDetectionCNN --Ice.Config=config```
The component will load the network and wait for input.
The input is given through remote procedure call. See component:
`testobjectDetectionCNN` 
for detection on real images and

    testobjectDetectionCNNsimulation
for object detection in simulation environment.
